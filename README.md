# RickRoll-Processing

Sample library for Processing, using a makefile for easier development.  Library may be cloned into your **sketchbook/libraries/** directory, or downloaded from the **.zip** file

Building from source requires Processing's **core.jar** file to be in the **sketchbook/libraries/** directory.

Use `make` to compile and create a **.jar** file.


Makefile may be used for your own libraries, just change the library name on line 9.  Specify source files after line 11.

A completed library may be turned into a zip file for publishing with `make zip`
